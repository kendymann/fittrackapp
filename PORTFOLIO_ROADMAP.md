# FitTrack App - Mobile Fitness Social Platform

## üì± **Vision Statement**
**The Problem**: Currently using Strava for cardio/running and Hevy for weightlifting means your fitness life is fragmented across multiple apps. You can't see your complete movement story in one place, and there's no unified community celebrating ALL types of activity.

**The Solution**: FitTrack combines weightlifting (sets, reps, PRs) and cardio/sports tracking (running, cycling, GPS, distance/pace, sport sessions) into a single, unified social platform. Making tracking all forms of movement‚Äîlifting, running, sports‚Äîjust normal living, not reserved for "hybrid athletes."

### Core Philosophy: "It's Just Living"
- **Unified tracking**: Your 5K run and bench press session deserve equal celebration
- **No labels needed**: Remove "hybrid athlete" - this is just how active people live
- **Complete story**: See your full movement journey in one place, one community
- **Inclusive community**: Celebrate all movement without fitness industry gatekeeping

## **Portfolio Demo Story**
*"I was tired of juggling Strava for my runs and Hevy for weightlifting - why should my fitness life be split across different apps and communities? FitTrack solves this by unifying all movement in one place. No more switching between apps to see your complete activity story."*

*"The bigger vision: remove the 'hybrid athlete' label entirely. This isn't about being some special type of athlete - it's just how people live. Some days you lift, some days you run, some days you play pickup basketball. FitTrack treats it all as equally valuable and celebrates your complete movement journey in one unified social hub."*

**The Personal Problem It Solves:**
- ‚ùå Strava doesn't understand your lifting progress
- ‚ùå Hevy doesn't care about your cardio achievements  
- ‚ùå Your fitness story is fragmented across platforms
- ‚ùå No single community celebrates ALL your activities
- ‚úÖ FitTrack: One app, one story, one community for living actively

**Key Demo Points:**
- ‚úÖ Log lifting session, then cardio run - both in same app
- ‚úÖ Social feed shows mixed activities from all users
- ‚úÖ Analytics that treat 100lb squat PR same as 5K PR
- ‚úÖ Community that celebrates movement without labels
- ‚úÖ "It's just living" - not "hybrid athlete training"

**Tech Showcase:**
- Full-stack web application (Express.js + MongoDB + React/Next.js)
- User authentication and protected routes
- RESTful API design
- Responsive UI with modern design
- Database design for flexible workout data
